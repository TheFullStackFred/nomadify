# Nomadify

Welcome to my master's thesis project! For my thesis, I decided to build a travel app that lets users log their destinations, add descriptions, and upload photos. The app is built using TypeScript, React Native, and Firebase.

My primary goal for this project is to create a user-friendly travel app that makes it easy for users to track their trips and also learn more about React Native, TypeScript, and Firebase. With Firebase, the app will have real-time data synchronization and offline capabilities, which will provide a seamless user experience.

As I explore the possibilities of these technologies, I also hope to gain a deeper understanding of how to create effective mobile applications. In addition to the core features, I plan to implement various advanced functionalities, such as user authentication.

Please stay tuned for updates on my progress!
